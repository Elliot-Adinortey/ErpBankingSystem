2. WHEN batch processing encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining operations
3. WHEN I request multiple account operations THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all changes made
4. WHEN batch operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed report of successes and failures
5. IF any batch operation fails THEN the system SHALL not rollback previous successful operations but SHALL clearly report the failure

### Requirement 7
